七七_thoughts_0: Qiqi is a healer, so her damage is not important. To maximize her damage, a healing bonus circlet is required. Qiqi heals a lot, and because of the ocean-hued clam artifact set, her performance in a Eula physical team is pretty good.

七七_符文治療: Talisman Heal
久岐忍_E半血治療: E half HP heal
久岐忍_thoughts_0: Kuki Shinobu is a healer, and the amount of healing you get increases more when you increase her HP instead of her EM, but EM gives you more damage. EM/EM/Heal bonus and HP/HP/Heal bonus have a difference of around 700 HP in terms of heal, so if you like you can bring EM. However even if Kuki brings EM, the catalyze damage is less than 10K, which is less than half of a Xinqiu without buff, so it doesn't make much sense tbh.

九條裟羅_Q吃鳥羽: Q after consuming feather
九條裟羅_thoughts_0: Kujou Sara has decent damage by herself, especially when fighting against large targets. She is a high multiplier character, so it is better to bring an ATK sand. If you need some ER then bring ER sands, considering that she already has ATK buff herself.
九條裟羅_thoughts_1: "Artifacts: ATK/ER sands, Electro DMG goblet, Crit Rate/DMG circlet\nSub stat: Crit Rate/DMG > ATK % > ER"
五郎_Q每次: Q DMG each time
五郎_thoughts_0: Gorou is the easiest character to build, he won't have any damage even if you give him good sub stats. Just level up his E and bring a Favonius bow to give some ER to his teammates, or even The Exile 4 piece to give Itto or Noelle ER. (Since Nobless is not very profitable for Itto and Noelle, The Exile is probably the most profitable artifact set)

亞蘿伊_Q滿線圈: Full coil Q

八重神子_thoughts_0: Yae Miko should use ATK/Electro/Crit Rate or DMG. If you don't care about her Q damage at C1, then EM sands is better, after C1 she can do one Q per rotation, so ATK sands is better than EM sands. After C2 ATK sands will always be better than EM sands.

凝光_thoughts_0: Ningguang lacks team synergy, and she can't outdamage five stars, so she's not very popular right now.
凝光_thoughts_1: Prototype Amber and Healing circlet can be equipped on Ningguang when teamed with Hu Tao-Xingqiu-Zhongli for Geo resonance and alleviate bleeding damage from Riftstalkers, especially the Golden Wolflord. She is also a catalyst user which comes in handy when combatting against Golden Wolflord for its shield.

刻晴_thoughts_0: Although Keqing applies electro well and is suitable for aggregate teams, ATK% sand is still better after calculations.
刻晴_thoughts_1: Keqing was used to melee DMG in the past, but now electro DMG Keqing is stronger with teammates such as Kazuha and Kujoh Sara, and with aggregate reaction. Charged attack knocks enemies back and is time-consuming, using EQE on electro Keqing is wiser.

北斗_Q閃電鏈: Thunderbeast's Targe
北斗_thoughts_0: Beidou in 3.0 isthe same as before, not because of the problem of Em profits, but because the 3.0 Aggravate system is less likely to choose Beidou, because Beidou needs normal attack to trigger her effects, and this conflicts with the machanism of the current Aggravate teams. For exaple, Tignahri uses charged attack, Keqing uses Eqe, the calculation results show that Keqing should do normal attacks as little as possible. Off-hand Electro characters like Yae Miko or Fischl fits better in the current Aggravate teams.

Although she hits at a very high rate, her electro application is actually very low, so it is not ideal to use her for Aggravate or Quicken reactions; instead the goal should be maximize her healing ability. To do so, a healing bonus circlet is needed, which is a common suggestion to any healer.\nArtifact Recommendation: HP%/ER sand, HP% goblet, healing bonus circlet;\nSub-stat Recommendation: HP% > ER"
夜蘭_Q協同: coordinated attacks
夜蘭_thoughts_0: Yelan's damage is connected to only her HP. So one shouldn't say that Hydro DMG bonus is better because it's literally the same as other main stats.
夜蘭_thoughts_1: For her ER, Yelan is better when she teams up with Raiden or Xinqiu. If you want to Q consistently you need C1, or else you need insanely high ER for Yelan. When Yelan is with Xinqiu, choose an ER weapon or ER sand, such as Aqua Simulacra + ER sand, Elegy for the End + HP sand.

So it can be considered that Tignari is better with EM. It's easy for Tighnari to use his ult every 12 seconds consistently in real battles, so he doesn't really need a lot of ER stats, not to mention the ER sands.\n\nArtifact main stat recommendations: EM sand, Dendro DMG bonus goblet, CD (CR) circlet.\nSub stat priority order: CR/CD > EM > ATK% > ER"

楓原萬葉_thoughts_0: Whether you are going for damage or increasing the team's damage, 3 EM is always the best for Kazuha. Especially in the 3.0 Dendor update, Kazuh's Electro swirl can also trigger Aggravate, pushing EM's value to even higher.

煙緋_thoughts_0: Yanfei's vaporize coverage is really high (almost 100%) because her charged attack, elemental skill, and elemental burst are calculated separately. Yanfei's A2 allows crit rate to have higher gain, so bringing some crit rate would be pretty good.

珊瑚宮心海_thoughts_0: 1 roll count of Hydro DMG can be seen as affecting both ATK and HP, almost scaling twice (though this is a bit of a stretch), but the point is that Hydro DMG is actually very helpful in increasing DMG. No matter if she is in charge of damage dealing or not, Kokomi is wearing a Healing Bonus circlet. For a support role, HP% goblet if running her solely on healing; a Hydro DMG goblet works too, and she can still heal your teammates very well.

申鶴_thoughts_0: 申鶴的機制比較特殊，說直接點，往死裡堆攻擊就完事了，別的什麼暴擊冰傷不用管。 除非帶西風的時候可以帶個暴擊頭。 申鶴目前只能配神裡綾華，別的都不好，在考慮要不要練申鶴的時候可以考慮一下這點。
申鶴_thoughts_1: Usually Shenhe only need ATK% for main stats. Because main stats and sub stats can't repeat, ER should be the first choice for sub stats. Shenhe can achieve 170% ER with sub stats while running on triple EM; ER sands are not needed.
申鶴_thoughts_2: The most common build is 2 Glad 2 Shimenawa because how easy they are to obtain, but in theory 4 pc Nob has the highest team dps.
申鶴_thoughts_3: "Recommended artifacts:\nMain stats: ATK% sand, ATK% goblet, ATK% circlet - Crit rate if 西風 is used\nSub stats: ATK% > ER% > Flat ATK"
砂糖_thoughts_0: Sucrose is an Anemo EM support. The higher her own EM, the more EM buff she can provide, so just stacking EM on her is enough. Traditional EM build also deals higher damage. Sucrose needs ER a lot, especially considering how important her burst is, so ER sands are good on her even when wearing Prototype Amber as weapon.

神里綾人_thoughts_0: The Namisen effect is similar to Kokomi's and Zhongli's, in a way that it has a certain amount of ATK buffs, causing subsequent ATK buffs to diminish, and Crit and DMG buffs are more effective. To increase Ayato's damage, ATK is more helpful than HP, by approximately 170%.

神里綾華_thoughts_0: When looking at her damage alone, ATK%/Cryo DMG/ATK% build has higher damage than ATK%/Cryo DMG/CD, leading to some people thinking ATK% circlet is better. In fact, because Ayaka can easily gain lots of ATK buffs from such as Thrilling Tales, Shenhe, and Noblesse, CD circlet fits her better in the end. 
神里綾華_thoughts_1: For Ayaka's ER, because she has teammates like Rosaria and Shenhe, she doesn't really need that much ER, so ER sands are not needed.

胡桃_thoughts_0: In most cases, Hutao shouldn't be focusing on stacking HP. ER sands deal more damage than HP sands, but the latter do not limit Hutao to only Vape teams - she also works in Triple Pyro teams. Additionally, in coop there often isn't consistent Hydro appliance, so HP sands allow you to deal more damage when carrying other players. Regarding survival, unless you don't have Zhongli, Hutao is always in the same team with him, so more HP doesn't really improve anything.

荒瀧一斗_thoughts_0: 'Before analyzing the curve, we should solve a small problem first: Itto''s base DEF is 959, base ATK 227. One roll of DEF substat is 1.875%, and one roll of ATK is 1.5%. His burst converts DEF to ATK and the ratio is greater than 1. 959*1.875% >（227+741）*1.5%. Thus Itto scales with DEF more than ATK.'
荒瀧一斗_thoughts_1: 再來看圖，防禦閾值僅有100% 不管你怎麼努力都會高出這個值，實際上只要有“雙暴靠找，防禦靠歪”的思想就可以了。 閾值低的原因和胡桃那會算生命的時候一樣，因為都是轉化為攻擊力，所以會受到原本已有攻擊力的稀釋。

莫娜_thoughts_0: 莫娜以輔助增傷為主，自身傷害是次要的。 在保證充能的前提下，可以去補點傷害，但其實也沒必要就是了。 充能提升水傷的效率只有25%，是比較低的，不建議以提高水傷為目的去找充能詞條，充能只要迴圈得起來就不用再找了。 圖中的水傷是以200充能為前提進行計算的，帶充能沙以後很容易就能到這個值
莫娜_thoughts_1: 聖遺物思路推薦： 莫娜增傷區比較高，而且沙漏會帶充能，這時候攻擊杯會更好。 副詞條里充能也不用找太多，一般莫娜是金珀充能沙，充能已經夠了就不用麻煩副詞條了。 充能沙、攻擊杯、暴擊（暴傷）頭 副詞條優先順序： 雙暴>（元素精通）≥攻擊>充能效率

菲謝爾_thoughts_1: 菲謝爾飾金4總傷更高的原因是因為飾金4給的屬性多，和精通收益是不搭界的，2+2隻有15增傷和18攻擊，但是飾金4能給14攻擊和180精通，它給的實在太多了

辛焱_thoughts_1: 6命有50%防禦轉攻擊（僅限重擊），辛焱防禦白值799，攻擊白值249，加上武器暫取800白值。 顯然，就算主打重擊，要堆攻擊就直接堆攻擊好了，防禦提升攻擊的效率只有一半，所以辛焱要提高傷害，還是得靠攻擊

重雲_thoughts_1: 重雲還可以在胡行鐘體系中，利用二命的減CD達到無縫迴圈不卡手的效果，這時候重雲當個掛件就行了裝備都可以不要，胡桃DPS夠了。 重雲的冰附魔在國家隊里可以做到行秋滅火→重雲凍結→香菱蒸發的combo，冰附魔在對陣水使徒和雷使徒時也有較好的效果——總之重雲不是特別吃裝備。

鍾離_E實際盾量: Shield absorption
鍾離_Q開盾天星: Meteor DMG
鍾離_thoughts_0: 鍾離作為全體瓦特最具安全感的男人，當然是以盾輔思路為主，這時候可以生生生+黑纓槍，成本低效果好。 除了所謂“血牛鍾離”，還有追求天星傷害的玩法，圖中的生命收益就是對於天星傷害而言的。 可以看到，生命對傷害的收益較低，原因和胡桃一樣，因為這會和已有的攻擊相互稀釋，反過來也意味著岩傷和雙暴對鍾離收益很高。

防禦力: Defense
阿貝多_E剎那之花: Transient Blossom
阿貝多_thoughts_0: 阿貝多的傷害絕大部分都來自於元素戰技的協同攻擊，有時候甚至會嫌阿貝多大招動畫浪費時間就把Q扣了，阿貝多的話主堆防禦就行了，攻擊可以不管。
阿貝多_thoughts_1: 阿貝多防禦閾值還是比較高的，現在依靠華館4和辰砂加上防禦沙，就可以達到閾值附近，安心帶暴擊頭就行了，以前還可能會考慮防禦頭。
阿貝多_thoughts_2: 聖遺物思路推薦： 增傷有就帶，不用擔心稀釋 防禦沙、岩傷杯、暴擊（暴傷）頭
阿貝多_thoughts_3: 副詞條優先順序： 雙暴（自適應）> 百分比防禦>百分比攻擊
雲堇_thoughts_0: 雲堇和申鶴十分相似，往死裡堆防禦就可以了。 帶了防防防以後因為主副詞條不能重複，沙杯冠最優先的副詞條就是充能，這樣下來靠副詞條搞到170充能是很正常的，再加上雲堇一般帶西風或者十文字，雲堇是沒必要充能沙的。 帶西風的時候可以選擇暴擊頭。
雲堇_thoughts_1: '聖遺物思路推薦： 防禦沙、防禦杯、防禦（西風時暴擊）頭 副詞條優先順序： 百分比防禦>元素充能效率'
雲堇_任意: ANY
雷澤_thoughts_0: 雷澤屬於萌新之友，大劍角色前期普攻倍率比較高，不容易刮痧，而且長按E在前期傷害很高，範圍大，無論是拍礦還是打怪都很猛。 後期實在是卷不過，打不了深淵。 雷澤是物理C，新手的時候可能會覺得這個E傷害好高，刷了雷杯，其實帶了物理以後體驗更好
雷澤_thoughts_1: 聖遺物思路推薦： 攻擊沙、物傷杯、暴擊（暴傷）頭 副詞條優先順序： 雙暴（自適應）>攻擊百分比>元素充能效率
雷澤_普攻第一段: First normal attack
雷電將軍_thoughts_0: 稻光雷神1詞條充能對傷害的提升在沒有溢出時高於1詞條攻擊或增傷; 不是稻光的話就不如攻擊增傷。 然後絕大多數情況都是雷杯好，畢竟雷國雷九這種標準體系都是帶班的。

香菱_Q踩班蒸發: In Bennett field vaporize
香菱_thoughts_0: 香菱的蒸發覆蓋率在實戰里就是接近100%的，這裡也是按100%算。 因為香菱的隊友統計中，班尼特出場率達到了95%，可以認為香菱就是綁定班尼特出場了。 班尼特的buff相當於130%左右的攻擊加成，這樣一來，香菱自己的面板上，就沒必要堆攻擊了，可以帶充能沙或者精通沙。
香菱_thoughts_1: '聖遺物思路推薦： 充能/精通沙、火傷杯、暴擊（暴傷）頭 副詞條優先順序： 雙暴（自適應）>元素精通>元素充能效率>百分比攻擊'
魈_thoughts_0: 魈是攻暴流風C，因為大招能夠提供高達90+的增傷，所以魈的攻擊區是收益比較高的，曾經還有過風杯攻擊杯之爭，但現在有了辰砂套，提供高額攻擊力，就一定是帶風杯了。
魈_thoughts_1: 魈的充能比較關鍵，還是比較有用的，一般會帶琴或者砂糖給魈充電，但魈還是有必要自己帶點充能詞條的，但充能沙不必了，副詞條裡注意一下就行。
魈_thoughts_2: '聖遺物思路推薦： 攻擊沙、風傷杯、暴擊（暴傷）頭 副詞條優先順序： 雙暴（自適應）>百分比攻擊>元素充能效率'
魈_開大首插: First plunge attack after Q

鹿野院平藏_E 滿蓄力: E full charged
鹿野院平藏_thoughts_0: 小鹿不屬於高頻低倍率的風系，自身倍率很高，所以要走攻暴流。 充能方面，自身大招只有40能量而且四命自帶回能，基本不需要什麼充能詞條。

麗莎_Q每段: Each pulse of Q
麗莎_thoughts_0: 麗莎阿..姐姐這個突破加精通很迷，自己E倍率上千，搞個突破加精通我真不知道啥意思，E的高倍率和Q的高頻率兩種優勢不管怎麼樣都要放棄一個。 總的來說還是攻擊沙更好一點。
