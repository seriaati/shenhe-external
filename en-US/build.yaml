七七_thoughts_0: Qiqi is a healer, so her damage is not important. To maximize her damage, a healing bonus circlet is required. Qiqi heals a lot, and because of the ocean-hued clam artifact set, her performance in a Eula physical team is pretty good.

久岐忍_E半血治療: E half HP heal
久岐忍_thoughts_0: Kuki Shinobu is a healer, and the amount of healing you get increases more when you increase her HP instead of her EM, but EM gives you more damage. EM/EM/Heal bonus and HP/HP/Heal bonus have a difference of around 700 HP in terms of heal, so if you like you can bring EM. However even if Kuki brings EM, the catalyze damage is less than 10K, which is less than half of a Xinqiu without buff, so it doesn't make much sense tbh.

五郎_Q每次: Q DMG each time
五郎_thoughts_0: Gorou is the easiest character to build, he won't have any damage even if you give him good sub stats. Just level up his E and bring a Favonius bow to give some ER to his teammates, or even The Exile 4 piece to give Itto or Noelle ER. (Since Nobless is not very profitable for Itto and Noelle, The Exile is probably the most profitable artifact set)

刻晴_thoughts_1: Keqing was used to melee DMG in the past, but now electro DMG Keqing is stronger with teammates such as Kazuha and Kujoh Sara, and with aggregate reaction. Charged attack knocks enemies back and is time-consuming, using EQE on electro Keqing is wiser.

北斗_thoughts_0: Beidou in 3.0 isthe same as before, not because of the problem of Em profits, but because the 3.0 Aggravate system is less likely to choose Beidou, because Beidou needs normal attack to trigger her effects, and this conflicts with the machanism of the current Aggravate teams. For exaple, Tignahri uses charged attack, Keqing uses Eqe, the calculation results show that Keqing should do normal attacks as little as possible. Off-hand Electro characters like Yae Miko or Fischl fits better in the current Aggravate teams.

夜蘭_thoughts_0: Yelan's damage is connected to only her HP. So one shouldn't say that Hydro DMG bonus is better because it's literally the same as other main stats.
夜蘭_thoughts_1: For her ER, Yelan is better when she teams up with Raiden or Xinqiu. If you want to Q consistently you need C1, or else you need insanely high ER for Yelan. When Yelan is with Xinqiu, choose an ER weapon or ER sand, such as Aqua Simulacra + ER sand, Elegy for the End + HP sand.

So it can be considered that Tignari is better with EM. It's easy for Tighnari to use his ult every 12 seconds consistently in real battles, so he doesn't really need a lot of ER stats, not to mention the ER sands.\n\nArtifact main stat recommendations: EM sand, Dendro DMG bonus goblet, CD (CR) circlet.\nSub stat priority order: CR/CD > EM > ATK% > ER"

珊瑚宮心海_thoughts_0: 1 roll count of Hydro DMG can be seen as affecting both ATK and HP, almost scaling twice (though this is a bit of a stretch), but the point is that Hydro DMG is actually very helpful in increasing DMG.

For a support role, HP% goblet if running her solely on healing; a Hydro DMG goblet works too, and she can still heal your teammates very well.

申鶴_thoughts_1: Usually Shenhe only need ATK% for main stats. Because main stats and sub stats can't repeat, ER should be the first choice for sub stats. Shenhe can achieve 170% ER with sub stats while running on triple EM; ER sands are not needed.

Additionally, in coop there often isn't consistent Hydro appliance, so HP sands allow you to deal more damage when carrying other players. Regarding survival, unless you don't have Zhongli, Hutao is always in the same team with him, so more HP doesn't really improve anything.

His burst converts DEF to ATK and the ratio is greater than 1. 959*1.875% >（227+741）*1.5%. Thus Itto scales with DEF more than ATK.'
荒瀧一斗_thoughts_1: 'Let''s look at the graph now. The threshold for DEF is only 100%. No matter how hard you try it will be more than this, so just focus on stacking CR/CD and if there is some DEF that''s also good.

莫娜_thoughts_0: Mona's build should prioritize on her support and damage buffing abilities, her own damage is less important. With enough ER, you can choose more offensive substats but this is not necessary. ER only increase Hydro damage by 25%, which is relatively low, so it is not recommeneded to stack ER to increase Hydro damage. ER only needs to be sufficient for your team rotations. The Hydro DMG in the graph is calculated based on 200% ER, which is easily achievable with ER sands.

菲謝爾_thoughts_1: The overall damage of Fischl running 4 Gilded is due to what the set can offer besides EM. 2+2 sets only have 15% damage bonus and 18% ATK, but 4 Gilded can give 14% ATK and 180 EM which is a lot.

諾艾爾_thoughts_0: First of all, Noelle scales with DEF more than ATK. With no other interference, DEF's curve should be the same as Phys DMG, capping at 170%. However, Noelle capped out at only 125%, clearly lower. This is due to the same reason for Hutao and Itto. Because of the conversion from DEF to ATK, there are diminishing returns with her base ATK. In other words, Noelles scales with Geo DMG and CR/CD a lot.

辛焱_thoughts_1: Xinyan's C6 converts 50% of DEF to ATK (only for Charged Attacks). Her base DEF is 799, base ATK 249, with the assumption of weapon giving 800 ATK. Apparently even if only using Charged Attacks, stacking ATK would be enough for her damage since DEF only offers half of that. Therefore to increase Xinyan's damage, stacking ATK is more fitting.

In National Team, Chongyun''s Cryo appliance can be used as follows: Xingqiu puts out fire → Chongyun freezes → Xiangling vapes. Cryo appliance is also very useful when facing Hydro and Electro abyss mages. All in all Chongyun doesn''t really rely on artifact or weapon. '

鍾離_E實際盾量: Shield absorption
鍾離_Q開盾天星: Meteor DMG
鍾離_thoughts_0: Zhongli as the most reassuring man of Teyvat, should of course focus on his shield support abilities. In this case triple HP and Black Tassel work well with little cost. Besides fully stacking HP on him, another playstyle focuses on his burst damage. The HP scaling in the picture is calculated based on that. We can see HP scales little with damage. This is due to the same reaosn for Hutao, receiving diminishing returns on top of base ATK. In other words, Zhongli scales with Geo DMG and CR/CD a lot.

防禦力: Defense
阿貝多_E剎那之花: Transient Blossom
阿貝多_thoughts_0: Most of Albedo's damage comes from his Elemental Skill. Some people even don't use his burst because the animation takes too long. Albedo only needs DEF; ATK is not necessary. 
阿貝多_thoughts_1: Albedo has a relatively high threshold for DEF. Now with 4 pc Husk, Cinnabar and DEF sands, it is easy to reach the threshold with a CR/CD circlet, while in the past DEF circlet was an option. 
阿貝多_thoughts_2: "Artifact Stat Recommendations: wear any DMG Bonus piece, no need to worry about diminishing returns\nDEF sands, Geo DMG goblet, CR/CD circlet"
阿貝多_thoughts_3: 'Sub stats: CR/CD > DEF% > ATK%'
雲堇_thoughts_0: Yunjin is very similar to Shenhe - just focus on stacking DEF. With triple DEF, because main ans sub stats don't repeat, the first choice for sub stats is ER. With this she can easily be at 170% ER. In addition, Yunjin often uses Fav Lance or Kitain, so she doesn't need ER sands. She can use CR circlet when using Fav. 
雲堇_thoughts_1: "Artifact Recommendations: DEF sands, DEF goblet, DEF circlet (CR when Fav)\nSub stats: DEF% > ER"
雲堇_任意: ANY
雷澤_thoughts_0: Razor is the friend of noobs. Claymore-wearing characters have higher NA scaling, and E (hold) deals a lot of damage in early game and also has large AoE, useful for collecting ores and facing enemies. In late game he can't compete with other characters in the Abyss. Razor is a Phys DMG DPS. While in early game his Elemental Skill might seem to deal a lot of damage thus giving him an Electro DMG goblet, in fact a Phys DMG goblet fits him better.

雷澤_普攻第一段: First normal attack
雷電將軍_thoughts_0: With Engulfing, one roll of ER stat increase more damage than ATK or Damage Bonus for Raiden before capping. With other weapon it is lower than the other two. In most cases Electro DMG goblet is better, since her teams often have Bennett in them.

香菱_Q踩班蒸發: In Bennett field vaporize
香菱_thoughts_0: Xiangling's Vape coverage is close to 100% in battle; here it is also calculated based on 100% coverage. Because statistically Bennett is in more than 95% of Xiangling's teams, we can assume the two are tied together. Bennett's buff is about 130% of ATK Bonus, hence Xiangling doesn't need to stack ATK and can choose ER or EM sands. 
香菱_thoughts_1: "Artifact Recommendations: ER/EM sands, Pyro DMG goblet, CR/CD circlet\nSub stats: CR/CD > EM > ER > ATK%"
魈_thoughts_0: Xiao is a DPS scaling with ATK and CR/CD. Because his burst can provide 90%+ Damage Bonus, so stacking ATK on him is more helpful. People used to argue which of Anemo DMG or ATK goblet is better, but with the release of Vermillion which gives a lot of ATK, it has come to the agreement of bringing Anemo DMG goblet. 
魈_thoughts_1: Xiao's ER is relatively important and desired. Though his teams usually have Jean or Sucrose for particle generation, Xiao still needs some ER stats. ER sands are not needed; a few sub stats are enough.

鹿野院平藏_E 滿蓄力: E full charged
鹿野院平藏_thoughts_0: Heizou is not a character who attacks often with low scalings. Since he has high scaling, stacking ATK and CR/CD on him is better. For ER, since his burst only requires 40 energy and his C4 also regenerages energy, he doesn't really need any ER stats.

麗莎_Q每段: Each pulse of Q
麗莎_thoughts_0: Lisa's ascension giving EM is weird to me. Her Elemental Skill scales over 1000% so I don't know why her ascension give EM. Between the high scaling of Elemental Scaling and frequent damage of Elemental Burst one has to be abandoned. Overall ATK sands are better.
